# Introduction to Jasmine: BDD for JavaScript

I made this presentation for [SenchaCon 2010](http://www.sencha.com/conference/).

To view the slides, you should be able to open `senchacon.html` from the root of this project in a recent build of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox. Navigate with your arrow keys.

(There's a bug w/ Chrome in that you need to hit RIGHT then LEFT to get the slides set up.)

Other notes:
